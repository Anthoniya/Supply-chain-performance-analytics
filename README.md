# üìä Supply Chain KPI Insights

This project simulates a real-world supply chain environment using a synthetic dataset of 2,500 global orders. It focuses on tracking and analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) across logistics, planning, and procurement functions. The objective is to uncover actionable insights related to delivery delays, shipping performance, product profitability, and order prioritization. These are core metrics that support data-driven decision-making in any supply chain context.

This project is relevant to roles in:
Logistics & Compliance: Dispatch delays, BNS tracking, shipping mode performance, exception handling
Supply Chain Planning: Delivery time by order priority, regional fulfillment trends, capacity insights
Procurement & Sourcing: Product-level profitability, supplier impact visibility, margin analysis
Operations Analytics: End-to-end KPI monitoring using SQL queries and Excel dashboards

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
SQL (MySQL) ‚Äì Data extraction, transformation, and KPI computation
Excel ‚Äì Dynamic dashboards, charts, and performance reports
Data Model ‚Äì Synthetic global superstore dataset (2,500+ orders across regions, segments, shipping modes)

üìä Core Analyses
Delivery Performance by Region ‚Äì Identify delay hotspots and prioritize operational improvements
Fulfillment Efficiency by Ship Mode ‚Äì Compare average delivery times across carrier types
Product Profitability ‚Äì Rank items by total profit and margin to inform sourcing and sales
Delivery Time by Order Priority ‚Äì Evaluate how well high-priority orders are fulfilled

üîé Future Enhancements
Integrate supplier data to assess on-time performance
Add inventory-level metrics to simulate stockouts and reorder points
Extend dashboards to visualize shipment exception trends over time

‚úÖ Project Outcome
The insights from this project can help logistics, supply chain, and operations teams:
Reduce delivery delays
Optimize transportation strategies
Improve planning around high-margin or high-priority items
Enhance decision-making using clean, visual performance metrics
